#### Concept:-
#### sort bcoz order dont matter in subset and then see that every element can be max and for for group just keep on adding
#### [1,2,3,4] here for 2 , 1 will come once in group and two subsets will be there [1,2] and [2] and ans will be (2*2) *1 + (2*2)*2
#### so sum or count for next subset will be prev = prev * 2 + curr .i.e (1*2) + 2 = 4
#### then in next for 3 , 1 will come twice and 2 once in subsets i.e [1,2,3],[1,3],[2,3] and [3] and ans will be (3*3)* 4 + (3*3*3)
#### now sum or count = (4*2) + 3;
