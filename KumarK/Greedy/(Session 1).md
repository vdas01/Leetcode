## Q1) Given an array of weights of items. Given a bag try to fill max no of items of total weight atmost k
## Q2) Given a binary array. There should be no subarray of size k or more whose average is 1. You can do operation:- Flip 1 to 0 or 0 to 1.Find min no of operations

### Concept:-
#### Avg will be 1 only if all the elements is 1 . So if all elemnts in subarray of size k is 1 then we have to do operation and using greedy we have to flip the last bit to increase it effect for next subaarays also.
