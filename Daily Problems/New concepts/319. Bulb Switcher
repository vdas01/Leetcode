//Question:-
There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs, then you turn off every second bulb.

On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the ith round, you toggle every i bulb. 
For the nth round, you only toggle the last bulb.

Return the number of bulbs that are on after n rounds.

class Solution {
public:
    int bulbSwitch(int n) {
        return floor(sqrt(n));
    }
};


//Concept:-
The light bulb at postion k must be toggled in odd number to stay on, e.g. 'On, Off, On' including the initial toggle. What triggers k-th bulb be toggled? 
Number k must be an exact multiple of each toggling. For example, when k=4, the bulb will be triggered by the 1st (On), 2nd (Off) and 4th (On) operation.
What is the exact number of multiple of a nature number k? All of its factors !

So the k-th bulb 'ON' is corresponding to the number of factors of k being odd. You can certainly develop a program to count. However, the number math tells us only 
perfect square numbers have odd number of factors, which is what needed for the bulb to stay on.

Great! Now to solve the problem is to find out how many perfect square number between 1 and n. The math kicks in again, and that number is the square root of
n (more preceisly the floor of sqaure root of n).x
